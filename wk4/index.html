            <h1>Dublin</h1>
            <p id="1"><strong>Dublin</strong> (/ˈdʌblɪn/; Irish: <em>Baile Átha Cliath</em>,<sup>[12]</sup> pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə
                ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland">Ireland</a>.<sup>[13][14]</sup> Situated on a bay
                on the east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey, it lies within the province of Leinster. It is bordered on
                the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. It has an urban area population of
                1,173,179,<sup>[8]</sup> while the population of the traditional County Dublin as a whole as of 2016 was
                1,347,359.<sup>[15]</sup> The population of the Greater Dublin Area was 1,904,806 per the 2016
                census.<sup>[16]</sup></p>

            <p id="2">There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where and when Dublin originated, with a settlement
                established by the Gaels during or before the 7th century CE,<sup>[17]</sup> and a second, Viking, settlement,
                following. As the small Kingdom of Dublin, the city grew, and it became Ireland's principal settlement following
                the Norman invasion.<sup>[17]</sup> The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second
                largest city in the British Empire after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin
                became the capital of the Irish Free State, later renamed Ireland.</p>

            <p id="3">Dublin is a contemporary and historical centre for Irish education, arts and culture, administration and
                industry. As of 2018 the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a
                global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the
                world.<sup>[18][19]</sup></p>
